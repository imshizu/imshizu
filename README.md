My name is Mikkel, and I'm a 17-year-old developer from Denmark. I'm interested in fullstack development, I'm most comfortable in Java, React, and TypeScript, and I'm working on learning Django.

Some notable projects of mine:
- **[Misha's Portfolio](https://github.com/imshizu/portfolio-misha)**, a modern and sleek portfolio page, for a friend of mine
- **[Generator Plugin](https://github.com/imshizu/generator)**, a Minecraft plugin, a simulator where people can earn money to buy new generators and become rich.

I've been programming since I was in elementary school, having begun to take it more seriously at the end of 2022, where I started programming Minecraft plugins and later transitioned into frontend and backend development. 

Outside of programming, I enjoy music, hanging out with friends, and learning new things.
